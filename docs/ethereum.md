## Creating Ethereum Wallet

Generally, all wallets created from most Ethereum wallet providers will be able to fulfill the app requirements. However, some wallet providers do not provide the ethereum wallet's private key in its 32 bytes form, generated based on elliptical curve ecp256k1, eg. `afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890`.

For a quick start guide on getting a free wallet to use with our demo app, refer to this [medium article](https://medium.com/@bitnautic/how-to-create-your-ethereum-wallet-4b047e4c217d).

Alternatively, you may visit MyEtherWallet to [create](https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/create/software?type=keystore) a new wallet then [access](https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/access/software?type=keystore) it and select `PORTFOLIO VALUE` -> `View paper wallet` to get the private key.
